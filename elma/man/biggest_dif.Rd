\title{
%%  ~~function to do ... ~~
Finds the biggest positive difference in a two minute window
}
\description{
%%  ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of what the function does. ~~

Finds the biggest positive difference between two MAP values in a two minute interval, and if this is greater than 8 TRUE is returned, if not then FALSE will be returned. If there a value below 65 it also checks if this is a part of a hypotensive event.

biggest_dif(table, i)

\arguments{
  \item{table}{ A dataframe.
%%     ~~Describe \code{x} here~~
}
  \item{i}{ An index.
%%     ~~Describe \code{x} here~~
}
}
\details{
%%  ~~ If necessary, more details than the description above ~~
Input should be a dataframe with two coloumns, one with MAP data and the other with HPI data, and the index input should be the index of the point in the table we have reached.
}
\value{
%%  ~Describe the value returned
%%  If it is a LIST, use
%%  \item{comp1 }{Description of 'comp1'}
%%  \item{comp2 }{Description of 'comp2'}
%% ...
A boolean value is returned, depending on the biggest difference found in the interval.
